this is the folder for scripts

There are three improtant scrips. 
1) gf_sims.R is the foundation of our simulation. This is what happens every generation and how we run it for a given parameter set.   
2) functions_forsummaries contains numerous helper functions to clean and tidy the raw output from gf_sims.R and transform this ugly output to a more useful form.   
3) runSims.R is a mess. It needs to be organized and cleaned, but it has some examples of parameter combinations i've looped across and how to make figures


to do. 
1) Include option (and calculations) to return components of haplotype frequency change over a generation. 
2) summarize major results etc 
3) provide quick 1-5 number summaries of a given simulation. 
4) WRITE
